            The programs on the site are meant to connect the procedures you learn in a Civil Engineering course with the physical stuff you are learning about. This is done with interactive 3D visuals and associated responsive equations.

            The site’s primarily for students enrolled in Civil Engineering courses, as well as instructors to help illustrate points. The topics assume you have the perquisite knowledge required to take the courses, usually at least calculus and physics. However, I think can also serve as a great tool for those curious in the material or the major. You may not understand everything, but I believe it may pique your interest.

            The topics are not comprehensive for the courses. I selected material which I think you could gain some real insight by visualizing it; some material is better suited for this medium than others. This also isn’t a substitute for studying the material. I think if it’s too easy, you’re likely not actually learning. Hopefully, however, this site will make that time spent struggling a bit more meaningful.
