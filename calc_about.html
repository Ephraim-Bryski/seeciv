      I'm working on a calculator for engineering. The goal is to give flexibility without the user being bogged down by programming. It's based on defining systems of equations in blocks which can build off of each other.</p>
      <p>I hope to add a library of these blocks for civil engineering design. 
      I'm also hoping to connect them to visuals like those on this site.</p>
      <p>Here's a very basic but working version of it:</p>
      <div>
        <p><a id="calclink" href="see_calc/see_calc.html" target="_blank">engineering calculator</a></p>
      </div>

<script>
    makeTabBar(document.getElementsByTagName("header")[0])
</script>
