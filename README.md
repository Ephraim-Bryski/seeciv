# seeciv
This is the code for the website seeciv.com. The sight will explore topics in Civil Engineering with the aid of interactive 3D graphics.

I hope to incorporate these graphics into a math solver project I am collaorating on called QuatumSheet: https://github.com/stefnotch/quantum-sheet. Here is the current roadmap: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khY9FJkwpUIDD7Q1wCzWFPmwEtcCwW_puN1Y9zYjKUk/edit

I'm always looking to collaorate with others on this project. If there's any topics you would want to see added work on, feel free to add an issue or join the Slack: slack://channel?id=C01TCELC4AH.
