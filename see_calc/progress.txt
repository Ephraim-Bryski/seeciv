stuff to work on before releasing


	bugs
		if no lines used in block, deletes all lines
		is nan being treated as a variable????????????????????? D:< fuck javascript
		check for NaN before passing into glowscript
		if there's an error, it still displays the visuals prior to the error
		the show steps final evaluate aren't latex


	tabular solving!!!!!!!
		by default all blank
		when you run it, output values are locked
		you have to click a button to reset


	zoom back to home

	accounts/library

		make library not super ugly

		ui for creating accounts, logging in etc
		save sheet in current locations with new data
		renaming sheet?

		Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace
		Option to clear sheet


	solver
		cannot solve system versus too much unknown????

		tests with remove vars too?

		i might want to do contradiction checks on individual equations after removing variables with a subtable (been going back and forth on it though D: )


		show more specific error in solve steps?

	UI

		make sure it looks good for different window sizes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




subscript with multiple characters!!!

firebase commands
	change sheet order in folder

plotting would be really nice :D



Bugs
	greek followed by nongreek splits

Solver Real stuff

	y=x^2 complexity is taken as 3 since *-1 adds to the complexity --> too much

	haven't handled this: combine_solve_term(eqn_to_tree("a*(a+a*b)+d"),"a")


Efficiency
	could be even faster by only simplifying where it's subbed in for sub_in function
	could save the tree from block to block so it doesn't have to parse repeatedly




Solving Superficial stuff to add/change

	making pi a numeric constant

	show all of the error messages and highlight the rows for sub table


Future not very important stuff

	slider which dynamically updates visual



	make visuals classes that could inherit from one another

	Draggable blocks





loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker
