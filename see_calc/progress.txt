Goal for end of summer: have something ready for use by others, don't worry about other stuff (e.g. lists, function, units, visualizations)
	visuald would be nice though, if there's time


symplify in beginning
format result in display
	rounding
	replace ** with ^
	latex?
display equations each in their own div 
each block has their own description
documentation
default to sub
implement solve for again
improve sub table
	look pretty
	option to clear row (and column?)
	duplicate row?
	refresh table
		should it just base it off of past results (so if the referenced blocks is modified it updates, but if it has its own reference which was modified, it's not updated)
		back propagate?? (would be hard)

don't resolve entire sheet when just the end of it changes (already wrote test.js which compares data structures)

button to add new block (probably wouldn't be clear otherwise)
	button to add line? (or pale line)

error messages
	invalid equation
	contradiction message might want to show both equations

working with greek letters?
	\w would be omega for example (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/converting-alphabets-to-greek-letters-in-javascript)
	could convert the input as well and unconvert when focused on it


	


block is deleted when name is empty (i thought i already fixed this O: )


allow user to download?
	ideally have a backend, but i dont think ill have enough time

when your cursor is on a variable it colors it and all other instances of that variable in the block

computations
	nsolve doesn't check negative yet

Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace

remove unnecessary parentheses (sub_all_vars should only add parentheses if there's an operation)



Sheet UI
	BUG: when you save a sheet it goes back to the home sheet
	Option to clear sheet
	Collapsible blocks
	Draggable blocks
	Some way to guide user, possible options:
		Prompts on the bottom with what can be done
		A mini tutorial
		Just seeing examples could helpful
		Little question mark buttons you can click on with info

Sheet computation
	Variables in an equation can’t have any block names (would be super confusing)

Line Notation/UI
	Latex result
	Greek letters
	Make substitution tabular
	Expand output when multiple equations
	Expand input box to fit input
	Red border around input when error reached

Line computation

	Trig function should be degrees
	Solve in terms of with steps
	More helpful guidance when it can’t solve would be nice


Error handling

Saving/sharing/library
	Saving something with period in name no good 








Stuff to make with calculator
	Node_edge for pipe networks
	Truss (with optimization hopefully)

Other Stuff to make
	Visuals would be important https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4839993/how-to-draw-polygons-on-an-html5-canvas 
	Lists: sum and diff (difference between neighboring elements)
	Units
	Databases
	If statements (might be ok if just goes one way)
	Functions (soil layers): integrate and derivatives, and evaluate
	optimization
