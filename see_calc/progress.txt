create math_to_latex function, why? :
	sin(a*b) becomes a weird mess with * instead of cdot
	a^1*b^-1*c^-1 becomes something with nested fractions


Solve Bugs

	dummy visual variables are being combined with commas in a string <-- not even sure if this is a bug

	multivariate newton rapshon no longer allows for redundant equations (e.g. a=4,a=4) <-- could be fixed by finding least square of inverse if nonsquare matrix
		AND can't solve certain problems (e.g. "A Network" library example)

UI Bugs
	able to delete all blocks
	
Solving features

	alphabetize variables <-- think this is for track variables

	variable is the name of a system


make pi a constant (don't appear in sub_table)

when new sheet is loaded it still takes info from previous sheet when solving --> reset start index to 0
	also loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker


infrastructure:
	right now:
		calc creates both sheet and visual eqns, they are then passed to a use_calc_results function which calls d2D and make_visuals
			this is confusing, and requires calc to be called when loaded (visual equations can't be stored, because you cant get them from D2d)
	instead you should:
		calc just creates sheet, passed to d2D which finds the visual eqns, calls make_visuals
			or maybe the visual eqns could be global??



Library
	Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace
	Saving something with period in name no good 

Sheet UI

	no underscores for variable names means also no subscripts
	Option to clear sheet
	Draggable blocks
	Some way to guide user, possible options:
		Prompts on the bottom with what can be done
		A mini tutorial
		Just seeing examples could helpful
		Little question mark buttons you can click on with info
	name of the opened sheet should be highlighted in the library
