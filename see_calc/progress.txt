if you reference a block with no variables, then change the line to something else, it doesn't allow you to input variables

give user error if they try adding multiple references of the same block in the same block

make visuals classes that could inherit from one another

the stuff being stored in library could be after calc
	calc(DOM2data(SoEs))
	then computations (and visuals!) can be shown without delay


visual doesn't get removed when no longer relevant


initial step shown should be simplification after initial substitutions


slider which dynamically updates visual

visuals could be displayed once all values substituted are numeric, instead of with solve
	would allow for visual to show up immediately when typed in




Solve Bugs


	not very important, but remove_common_vars converts a*b+b to a+1 which is a problem if it's actually b that's 0 <-- not gonna worry about this for now

	remove_vars throws error instead of removing equation
	
	typing 1/2a instead of 1/2*a leads to solving 1/(2*a) 

	multivariate newton rapshon no longer allows for redundant equations (e.g. a=4,a=4) <-- could be fixed by finding least square of inverse if nonsquare matrix
		AND can't solve certain problems (e.g. "A Network" library example)

UI Bugs

	able to delete all blocks


	
Solving features

	alphabetize variables <-- think this is for track variables

	prevent variable from being the name of a system


make pi a constant (don't appear in sub_table)

when new sheet is loaded it still takes info from previous sheet when solving --> reset start index to 0
	also loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker


infrastructure:
	right now:
		calc creates both sheet and visual eqns, they are then passed to a use_calc_results function which calls d2D and make_visuals
			this is confusing, and requires calc to be called when loaded (visual equations can't be stored, because you cant get them from D2d)
	instead you should:
		calc just creates sheet, passed to d2D which finds the visual eqns, calls make_visuals
			or maybe the visual eqns could be global??



Library
	Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace
	Saving something with period in name no good 

Sheet UI

	no underscores for variable names means also no subscripts
	Option to clear sheet
	Draggable blocks
	Some way to guide user, possible options:
		Prompts on the bottom with what can be done
		A mini tutorial
		Just seeing examples could helpful
		Little question mark buttons you can click on with info
	name of the opened sheet should be highlighted in the library
