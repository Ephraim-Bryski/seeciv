Sheet UI
	BUG: when you save a sheet it goes back to the home sheet
	Option to clear sheet
	Collapsible blocks
	Draggable blocks
	Some way to guide user, possible options:
		Prompts on the bottom with what can be done
		A mini tutorial
		Just seeing examples could helpful
		Little question mark buttons you can click on with info

Sheet computation
	Variables in an equation can’t have any block names (would be super confusing)
	Easy way to move lines to other blocks (maybe with autorefactoring?)

Line Notation/UI
	Latex result
	Greek letters
	Make substitution tabular
		makes it much easier to see how variables are flowing, much easier to catch mistakes
		if cell is empty it would remove that variable by solving (e.g. [a+b=c, a+4=7] if a sub is empty, produces [7-4+b=c])
		initializes with table with all variables in the referenced block and the output is the same (i.e. no substitution)
		tabular sub getting a bit tricky because it would have to figure out whether to reset the table 
			if the reference stays the same but the referenced block changes, ideally it shouldn't reset the table (so you keep all your subs), just adds/removes variables
			maybe there could be a reset table option, if you hit Ctrl+Etr and the referenced block changes, you just get an error, idk
		if multiple substitutions in block, creates bigger table
		color coded
			gray: in and out same (no substitution)
			black: out is empty (solved to remove variable)
			green: in out different (just substitute the variable)
			grayed out (can't type in it): variable is in a different reference so part of the table not this reference
				i think lines should only share a table if the reference is the same (so you wouldn't need grayed out)
	Expand output when multiple equations
	Expand input box to fit input
	Red border around input when error reached

Line computation
	Trig function should be degrees
	Input for substitution should have to be variable
	Nerdamer should check all lines (a=b++3 doesn’t throw an error until you solve with it)
	Order shouldn’t matter for substitution
	Check all variables being substituted are part of the block (won't be relevant if i'm using tabular substitution)
	Partial solving (soil properties) might need to use the code for algebraic solving I wrote before
		Maybe construct a graph of variables in equations and see if there’s any thing you don’t need (e.g. a=b,b=c*f     if you only want a and b you can remove the second eqn)
		partial solving done with tabular substitution
	Handle infinity and complex
	Assume positive values?
	Solve in terms of with steps
	More helpful guidance when it can’t solve would be nice


Error handling
	Investigate errors for solving

Saving/sharing/library
	Saving something with period in name no good 
	Give an error if you try to save it with an existing name
	Create library of blocks
	Loading blocks should add to sheet instead of replacing 
	User accounts

Stuff to make with calculator
	Node_edge for pipe networks
	Truss (with optimization hopefully)

Other Stuff to make
	Visuals would be important https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4839993/how-to-draw-polygons-on-an-html5-canvas 
	Lists: sum and diff (difference between neighboring elements)
	Units
	Databases
	If statements (might be ok if just goes one way)
	Functions (soil layers): integrate and derivatives, and evaluate
	optimization
