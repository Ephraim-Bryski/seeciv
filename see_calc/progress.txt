Solver Bugs






	dummy visual variables are being combined with commas in a string <-- not even sure if this is a bug




Solving features


	autooperatornames in mathquill config can be used to make text keywords

	round, including rounding in equations with long fractions



	specify if failure is due to contradiction or something else

	alphabetize variables <-- think this is for track variables


	substitute group terms if it's shared across equations, would allow it to get S*e=Gs*w by cancelling out v
		tries to find biggest term to sub across equations
			maybe only when there's only 2 eqns, would get too complex otherwise




issues with remove_uneeded_exps (currently not using)


	remove_uneeded_exps can delete all equations
	need to do a check (same check as keeping it in the while loop: one eqn or nothing to sub out) after the unnecessary equations are removed, otherwise uncaught error in sub_out






when new sheet is loaded it still takes info from previous sheet when solving --> reset start index to 0
	also loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker


sub_table doesn't get removed when it's no longer relevant for the input
	not sure how it should behave though



infrastructure:
	right now:
		calc creates both sheet and visual eqns, they are then passed to a use_calc_results function which calls d2D and make_visuals
			this is confusing, and requires calc to be called when loaded (visual equations can't be stored, because you cant get them from D2d)
	instead you should:
		calc just creates sheet, passed to d2D which finds the visual eqns, calls make_visuals
			or maybe the visual eqns could be global??


add info to sheets


name of the opened sheet should be highlighted in the library
	



line should expand with text

each block has their own description
documentation


error messages
	contradiction message might want to show both equations
	variable is the name of a system

working with greek letters?
	\w would be omega for example (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/converting-alphabets-to-greek-letters-in-javascript)
	could convert the input as well and unconvert when focused on it



angle default to degrees

calculations
	divide by 0 error leads to it saying it's too difficult to solve
	contradiction can lead to numeric solve error



what has to be done in display

	(optional: move negative stuff to the other side of the equal sign)




when your cursor is on a variable it colors it and all other instances of that variable in the block


Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace




Sheet UI
	Option to clear sheet
	Draggable blocks
	Some way to guide user, possible options:
		Prompts on the bottom with what can be done
		A mini tutorial
		Just seeing examples could helpful
		Little question mark buttons you can click on with info



Line Notation/UI
	Latex result
	Greek letters
	Expand input box to fit input
	Red border around input when error reached


Saving/sharing/library
	Saving something with period in name no good 








Stuff to make with calculator
	Node_edge for pipe networks
	Truss (with optimization hopefully)

Other Stuff to make
	Visuals would be important https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4839993/how-to-draw-polygons-on-an-html5-canvas 
	Lists: sum and diff (difference between neighboring elements)
	Units
	Databases
	If statements (might be ok if just goes one way)
	Functions (soil layers): integrate and derivatives, and evaluate
	optimization
		pso
