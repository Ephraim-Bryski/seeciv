the only issue with login is it doesn't work with launch.json
so i have to wait until the end to transfer everything over



quick stuff to do

	use degrees instead of radians would actually be pretty simple
		just change take_trig_func in cas

	max, min, deg are keywords in mathquill -- get rid of this
	

	the view doesn't adjust when the visual translates, only when zoom changes
		still need to decide whether to center at origin



stupid CSS

	prevent the glowscript canvas from going just a tad bit outside the window
		leads to annoying scroll bars
			
	sub table errors shouldn't have arrows you have to expand
		and it should be red



stuff to do at end

	figure what to do with remove parentheses or some simplfiy for sub table

	visual keyword

	undo and redo, i think i got rid of it cause getting caught in tracking changes got annoying
	block and/or sheet info

	don't allow people to delete library sheets
	improve numeric solver
	stupid tiny sub table rectangle

	catch all error so it doesn't break if some weird error comes up



visuals to create

	for bars in tension in compression, i could have diagonal lines both ways (creating squares)
		then the squares will deform

	random stuff
		balloon, how the pressure after a certain point goes down cause the rubber thins
		you could have load suspended 3 points in 3d space, show how the tension changes with the angles
		car differential
		different stuff for mechanical advantage

	hydrualics
		pipes (network)
		pipes in series with grad lines
		weirs (discharge of different shapes?)
	mechanics
		basically all the stuff from old seeciv 
		mohr's circle <-- could be very useful
		torsion (and with multiple rods)
		beam moment shear (distributions would be built into the visual)
		bending (honestly not that interesting a visual)
	3bar linkage, already have 
		could do other mechanisms even 3D
	statics
		might need vector primitive to be very useful
		could have forces on something balanced out
	geotech/foundations
 		soil layers stresses
			would want to have functions, but could use trapezoids
		soil stress over area from loads
			would need color plot (more generally subbing an expresion instead of a value)
		foundations
			issue is a lot of them are piecewise
	
	structural
		section properties

		beam loading??
			again would need function
	
	physics

		springs and forces and stuff (probably not dynamic)

		projectile motion (would just need sphere primitive)

	water treatment

		size of things like the spinny things
	
	numerical analysis??? need to think about that


CAS
	
	0=0 should be removed, at least from eqns to display
	simplify top exponent out and top product coefficients????
		getting stuck on this

	tests with remove vars too?
	y=x^2 complexity is taken as 3 since *-1 adds to the complexity --> too much
	haven't handled this: combine_solve_term(eqn_to_tree("a*(a+a*b)+d"),"a")

Efficiency

	could be even faster by only simplifying where it's subbed in for sub_in function
	could save the tree from block to block so it doesn't have to parse repeatedly

Future not very important stuff

	visual color as another input

	input expressions instead of just values to plotting

	make visuals classes that could inherit from one another
	Draggable blocks
	loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker
	Symbolic if statements
	Max, min, and inequalities

	sliders, or even play <-- would allow for a lot of dynamics stuff to actually make sense
