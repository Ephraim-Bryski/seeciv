a*b=0, a=1 leads to b=0, a=0

basically, how i have it now, it immediately solves a*b=0 as a=0, with b=0 as the other product branch
	then converts a-1 to (0-1)*b, then solving that as b=0

CANT IMMEDIATELY SOLVE

instead, do all eqns without top level products FIRST
then solve all permutations of possible systems
check whether there's one remaining system







Issues easily handled with custom solver (no nerdamer :D )
	initial step shown should be simplification after initial substitutions
	not very important, but remove_common_vars converts a*b+b to a+1 which is a problem if it's actually b that's 0 <-- not gonna worry about this for now

	multivariate newton rapshon no longer allows for redundant equations (e.g. a=4,a=4) <-- could be fixed by finding least square of inverse if nonsquare matrix
		AND can't solve certain problems (e.g. "A Network" library example)
		honestly not sure what to do about this right now, but multivariate will likely no longer be needed

	make pi a constant (don't appear in sub_table)

// TODO show all of the error messages and highlight the rows

decide about if i want to convert to degrees <-- might be simpler once i make a custom solver

TODO
	
	visual doesn't get removed when no longer relevant <-- would have to first have visuals created in d2D first, then i could just call resetGS at the start of d2D


remove_vars throws error instead of removing equation <-- cannot recreate/understand bug

make visuals classes that could inherit from one another <-- see how important this actually is

slider which dynamically updates visual

visuals could be displayed once all values substituted are numeric, instead of with solve
	would allow for visual to show up immediately when typed in
	this could be done in data2DOM instead so that it can be done without any calculation on library load



when new sheet is loaded it still takes info from previous sheet when solving --> reset start index to 0
	also loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker


Library (future)
	Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace
	Saving something with period in name no good 

Sheet UI (future)

	Option to clear sheet
	Draggable blocks
	Some way to guide user, possible options:
		A mini tutorial
		Little question mark buttons you can click on with info
	name of the opened sheet should be highlighted in the library
