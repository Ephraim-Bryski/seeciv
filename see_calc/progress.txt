substitute group terms if it's shared across equations, would allow it to get S*e=Gs*w by cancelling out v
	tries to find biggest term to sub across equations
		maybe only when there's only 2 eqns, would get too complex otherwise


OR maybe not

each step try finding biggest term to sub across equations

find all shared, then find the largest common factor across all of them
	would just reduce to a problem with nested arrays

this way doesn't need to guess variable

needs to find intersection 
	a,b,c and b,c,d --> b,c (each letter is a term) <-- gcf
-->
but then problem, getting all possible intersections would be way too slow
-->
need efficient way to get largest interesections
-->
problem: get largest intersection in array of sets (efficiently)

then among those largest ones (in most cases all just one element)
	find one where the rest of the stuff is the simplest for ONE particular equation
		if the terms have more complex product terms --> BAD (not necessarily not allowed though, just lowest priority)
		but terms with more complex base i think is actually better, since it would be cancelled out


i don't think it matters if it's shared in the most equations
	if anything it should be shared in the fewest

might be faster and safer to still sort the equations simplest to most complex (using naive number of ops method)
then get gcf between that equation and all other equations
	much faster than between all equations
	plus if it can be solved now, it can definitely be solved this way too



needs to find 
	simplest (no stuff inside the product terms allowed)
	largest term (most products)
	shared most across equations
	shared most in equation across sum terms?
[[a,b],[c,d]]   []

would also get into issue where text couldn't be directly subbed 
	a/b couldn't be subbed into a*c/b
	this means you would need to sub directly into the trees, and then condense the trees <-- just way too much work


SOOOO INSTEAD

just do the simple hacky solution

when there's only two equations:



find all product terms in both consisting of remove variables
	(a+b)*c where a and c is remove and b isn't: OK (since a still needs to be removed)
	
	if there are different product terms (across sum or equation), return and just do it the regular way

	solve for this larger term for both equations
	then just set the two equal to one another

Eqn1
	{["a",1],["b",2]}
	{} <-- no remove vars in that sum term
Eqn2
	{["a",1],["b",2]}


don't even need to check interesection, literally just check if they all match










Bugs

	dummy visual variables are being combined with commas in a string <-- not even sure if this is a bug

	sub_table doesn't get removed when it's no longer relevant for the input
		not sure how it should behave though



Solving features

	round, including rounding in equations with long fractions

	alphabetize variables <-- think this is for track variables

	contradiction message might want to show both equations
	variable is the name of a system



when new sheet is loaded it still takes info from previous sheet when solving --> reset start index to 0
	also loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker


infrastructure:
	right now:
		calc creates both sheet and visual eqns, they are then passed to a use_calc_results function which calls d2D and make_visuals
			this is confusing, and requires calc to be called when loaded (visual equations can't be stored, because you cant get them from D2d)
	instead you should:
		calc just creates sheet, passed to d2D which finds the visual eqns, calls make_visuals
			or maybe the visual eqns could be global??



Library
	Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace
	Saving something with period in name no good 

Sheet UI

	no underscores for variable names means also no subscripts
	Option to clear sheet
	Draggable blocks
	Some way to guide user, possible options:
		Prompts on the bottom with what can be done
		A mini tutorial
		Just seeing examples could helpful
		Little question mark buttons you can click on with info
	name of the opened sheet should be highlighted in the library
