Calculating... text should be much more obvious (in center on top)   

would be nice to allow solve for to be symbolic if there's only one equation

sub table buttons for rows and columns (rows: clear and reset) (columns: reset and number)

add info to sheets

	for new users it could be confusing that it deletes the block if there's no block name or no equations (it would get frustrating having it get deleted over and over again)
	make default SoE name


name of the opened sheet should be highlighted in the library
	
	button to add line? (or pale line)

break up equations from sub_table into columns

backslash in variable leads to "too difficult for program to solve"

line should expand with text

each block has their own description
documentation

make sub table pretty

error messages
	contradiction message might want to show both equations
	variable is the name of a system

working with greek letters?
	\w would be omega for example (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/converting-alphabets-to-greek-letters-in-javascript)
	could convert the input as well and unconvert when focused on it



angle default to degrees

calculations
	divide by 0 error leads to it saying it's too difficult to solve
	contradiction can lead to numeric solve error



what has to be done in display

	(optional: move negative stuff to the other side of the equal sign)








allow user to download?
	ideally have a backend, but i dont think ill have enough time

when your cursor is on a variable it colors it and all other instances of that variable in the block


Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace




Sheet UI
	Option to clear sheet
	Draggable blocks
	Some way to guide user, possible options:
		Prompts on the bottom with what can be done
		A mini tutorial
		Just seeing examples could helpful
		Little question mark buttons you can click on with info



Line Notation/UI
	Latex result
	Greek letters
	Expand input box to fit input
	Red border around input when error reached


Saving/sharing/library
	Saving something with period in name no good 








Stuff to make with calculator
	Node_edge for pipe networks
	Truss (with optimization hopefully)

Other Stuff to make
	Visuals would be important https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4839993/how-to-draw-polygons-on-an-html5-canvas 
	Lists: sum and diff (difference between neighboring elements)
	Units
	Databases
	If statements (might be ok if just goes one way)
	Functions (soil layers): integrate and derivatives, and evaluate
	optimization
		pso
