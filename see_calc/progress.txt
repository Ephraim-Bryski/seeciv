stuff to work on before releasing




	cannot solve system versus too much unknown????

	Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace
	Option to clear sheet



	save sheet in current locations with new data

	renaming sheet?


	make library not super ugly

	ui for creating accounts, logging in etc



	tests with remove vars too??



	displaying solution, don't have equations all in one line

`	

	i might want to do contradiction checks on individual equations after removing variables with a subtable (been going back and forth on it though D: )




	when new sheet is loaded it still takes info from previous sheet when solving --> reset start index to 0




	basic interactions with visuals (zoom, home, pan)




	make sure it looks good for different window sizes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




subscript with multiple characters!!!

firebase commands
	change sheet order in folder

plotting would be really nice :D



Bugs
	greek followed by nongreek splits

Solver Real stuff

	y=x^2 complexity is taken as 3 since *-1 adds to the complexity --> too much

	haven't handled this: combine_solve_term(eqn_to_tree("a*(a+a*b)+d"),"a")


Efficiency
	could be even faster by only simplifying where it's subbed in for sub_in function
	could save the tree from block to block so it doesn't have to parse repeatedly




Solving Superficial stuff to add/change

	making pi a numeric constant

	show all of the error messages and highlight the rows for sub table


Future not very important stuff

	slider which dynamically updates visual



	make visuals classes that could inherit from one another

	Draggable blocks





loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker
