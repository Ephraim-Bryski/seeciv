quick stuff to do

	max, min, deg are keywords in mathquill -- get rid of this
	

	the view doesn't adjust when the visual translates, only when zoom changes
		still need to decide whether to center at origin



stupid CSS
	
	sub table errors shouldn't have arrows you have to expand
		and it should be red

	figure out what tooltips to have
		Undo and Redo if i use arrows
		really don't think add and delete buttons need tooltips but ok for now

	make it so some top menu buttons appear conditionally
		log in --> save field and button

	add fontawesome icons



stuff to do at end

	figure what to do with remove parentheses or some simplfiy for sub table

	visual keyword

	undo and redo, i think i got rid of it cause getting caught in tracking changes got annoying
	block and/or sheet info

	try to have google sign in
	don't allow people to delete library sheets
	improve numeric solver
	stupid tiny sub table rectangle

	catch all error so it doesn't break if some weird error comes up



visuals to create
	hydrualics
		pipes (network)
		open channel
		water waves (probably sine/cnoidal/whatever profile would be built into visual)
		weirs (discharge of different shapes?)
	mechanics
		basically all the stuff from old seeciv 
		mohr's circle <-- could be very useful
		3d stress strain (you could fix things like strain in one direction)
		torsion (and with multiple rods)
		beam moment shear (distributions would be built into the visual)
		bending (honestly not that interesting a visual)
	3bar linkage, already have 
		could do other mechanisms even 3D
	planetary gears, maybe even auto transmission
	statics
		might need vector primitive to be very useful
		could have forces on something balanced out
	geotech/foundations
		soil properties, could have soil layers visual made of cylinders
		soil layers stresses
			would want to have functions, but could use trapezoids
		soil stress over area from loads
			would need color plot (more generally subbing an expresion instead of a value)
		foundations
			issue is a lot of them are piecewise
	
	structural
		section properties

		beam loading??
			again would need function
	
	physics

		springs and forces and stuff (probably not dynamic)

		projectile motion (would just need sphere primitive)

	water treatment

		size of things like the spinny things
	
	numerical analysis??? need to think about that


CAS
	
	0=0 should be removed, at least from eqns to display
	simplify top exponent out and top product coefficients????
		getting stuck on this

	tests with remove vars too?
	y=x^2 complexity is taken as 3 since *-1 adds to the complexity --> too much
	haven't handled this: combine_solve_term(eqn_to_tree("a*(a+a*b)+d"),"a")

Efficiency

	could be even faster by only simplifying where it's subbed in for sub_in function
	could save the tree from block to block so it doesn't have to parse repeatedly

Future not very important stuff

	visual color as another input

	input expressions instead of just values to plotting

	make visuals classes that could inherit from one another
	Draggable blocks
	loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker
	Symbolic if statements
	Max, min, and inequalities

	sliders, or even play <-- would allow for a lot of dynamics stuff to actually make sense
