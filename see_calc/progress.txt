what would change
	D2d: create separate entry for solve
	calc: stuff outside




quick stuff to do

	function to change sheet order (not exposed to user for now)
	visual color as another input
	input line shouldn't have arrows (i don't think looking at the simplified is useful)
	Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace
	stupid tiny sub table rectangle

do when moving solving out of line

	sliders, or even play <-- would allow for a lot of dynamics stuff to actually make sense
	doesn't show steps if there's an error when solving
	show more specific error in solve steps?
	variable cell width

stuff to do at end

	visual keyword
	big black region to the right of the library
	fix 404 page
	undo and redo, i think i got rid of it cause getting caught in tracking changes got annoying
	block and/or sheet info
	make sure it looks good for different window sizes
	add fontawesome icons
	figure out what tooltips to have
	try to have google sign in
	improve numeric solver
	making pi a numeric constant <-- could be harder than it looks....

Harder stuff

	input expressions instead of just values to plotting

visuals to create
	hydrualics
		pipes (network)
		open channel
		water waves (probably sine/cnoidal/whatever profile would be built into visual)
		weirs (discharge of different shapes?)
	mechanics
		basically all the stuff from old seeciv 
		mohr's circle <-- could be very useful
		3d stress strain (you could fix things like strain in one direction)
		torsion (and with multiple rods)
		beam moment shear (distributions would be built into the visual)
		bending (honestly not that interesting a visual)
	3bar linkage, already have 
		could do other mechanisms even 3D
	planetary gears, maybe even auto transmission
	statics
		might need vector primitive to be very useful
		could have forces on something balanced out
	geotech/foundations
		soil properties, could have soil layers visual made of cylinders
		soil layers stresses
			would want to have functions, but could use trapezoids
		soil stress over area from loads
			would need color plot (more generally subbing an expresion instead of a value)
		foundations
			issue is a lot of them are piecewise
	
	structural
		section properties

		beam loading??
			again would need function
	
	physics

		springs and forces and stuff (probably not dynamic)

		projectile motion (would just need sphere primitive)

	water treatment

		size of things like the spinny things
	
	numerical analysis??? need to think about that


CAS
	
	tests with remove vars too?
	y=x^2 complexity is taken as 3 since *-1 adds to the complexity --> too much
	haven't handled this: combine_solve_term(eqn_to_tree("a*(a+a*b)+d"),"a")

Efficiency

	could be even faster by only simplifying where it's subbed in for sub_in function
	could save the tree from block to block so it doesn't have to parse repeatedly

Future not very important stuff

	make visuals classes that could inherit from one another
	Draggable blocks
	loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker
	Symbolic if statements
	Max, min, and inequalities
