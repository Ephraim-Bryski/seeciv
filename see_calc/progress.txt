Goal for end of summer: have something ready for use by others, don't worry about other stuff (e.g. lists, function, units, visualizations)
	visuald would be nice though, if there's time


STUPID JS IS MAKING IT HARD TO DO THE ONLY COMPUTE NEW STUFF SO IM MOVING ON TO OTHER STUFF FOR NOW

check for complex following a substitution

solve is initially undefined

loading bar

descriptions of variables

default to sub

format result in display
	rounding
	remove parentheses
	replace ** with ^
	latex?
symplify in beginning (if an eqn has a=a, it will throw an error since "a" will be considered a variable)
don't resolve entire sheet when just the end of it changes (already wrote test.js which compares data structures)
button to add new block (probably wouldn't be clear otherwise)
	button to add line? (or pale line)


line should expand with text

display equations each in their own div 
each block has their own description
documentation

make sub table pretty

error messages
	invalid equation
	contradiction message might want to show both equations
	variable is the name of a system

working with greek letters?
	\w would be omega for example (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/converting-alphabets-to-greek-letters-in-javascript)
	could convert the input as well and unconvert when focused on it



angle default to degrees



info on hover


what has to be done in display
	evaluate
	round
	(optional: move negative stuff to the other side of the equal sign)

	convert to latex
	
	latex(N(exp,3)) where 3 is the number of decimal places


block is deleted when name is empty (i thought i already fixed this O: )


allow user to download?
	ideally have a backend, but i dont think ill have enough time

when your cursor is on a variable it colors it and all other instances of that variable in the block


Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace




Sheet UI
	BUG: when you save a sheet it goes back to the home sheet
	Option to clear sheet
	Draggable blocks
	Some way to guide user, possible options:
		Prompts on the bottom with what can be done
		A mini tutorial
		Just seeing examples could helpful
		Little question mark buttons you can click on with info



Line Notation/UI
	Latex result
	Greek letters
	Expand output when multiple equations
	Expand input box to fit input
	Red border around input when error reached

Line computation

	Trig function should be degrees
	More helpful guidance when it canâ€™t solve would be nice


Error handling

Saving/sharing/library
	Saving something with period in name no good 








Stuff to make with calculator
	Node_edge for pipe networks
	Truss (with optimization hopefully)

Other Stuff to make
	Visuals would be important https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4839993/how-to-draw-polygons-on-an-html5-canvas 
	Lists: sum and diff (difference between neighboring elements)
	Units
	Databases
	If statements (might be ok if just goes one way)
	Functions (soil layers): integrate and derivatives, and evaluate
	optimization
