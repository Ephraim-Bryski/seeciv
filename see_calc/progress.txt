UI stuff?
	error messages for each row of substituion table

Solver Real stuff

	arctan needs to be converted into atan 
	y=x^2 complexity is taken as 3 since *-1 adds to the complexity --> too much

	haven't handled this: combine_solve_term(eqn_to_tree("a*(a+a*b)+d"),"a")

	handle multiple product solutions (recursively solve on all permutations, after solving everything else first)
	in eqn_to_tree, it shouldn't catch parentheses mismatch instead of infinite recursion (doesnt REALLY matter, but so ugly now)

Efficiency
	could be even faster by only simplifying where it's subbed in for sub_in function
	could save the tree from block to block so it doesn't have to parse repeatedly


Solving Superficial Bugs





Solving Superficial stuff to add/change

	displaying solution, don't have equations all in one line


	making pi a numeric constant

	show all of the error messages and highlight the rows for sub table

	show steps with forward and numeric solve too
	initial step shown should be simplification after initial substitutions





Visuals

	visuals whenever all numeric values subbed

	implement visuals with this new solver

	only show visual when relevant (like dont show giant axes when there's no visual)

Superficial UI issues

	no need for the side bar with checks, nor those stupid green borders

	make library not super ugly



Stuff to implement
	ui for creating accounts, logging in etc



Future not very important stuff

	slider which dynamically updates visual



	make visuals classes that could inherit from one another

	Option to either add blocks to sheet or replace
	Option to clear sheet
	Draggable blocks





when new sheet is loaded it still takes info from previous sheet when solving --> reset start index to 0
	also loading a sheet has to have a callback to update the variable tracker


Library (future)
	
	Saving something with period in name no good
