    <div class="title">About the Code</div>
    <p>
        The site and programs are coded in native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The 3D graphics were created using <a href="glowscript.org">GlowScript</a> and the equations were created using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" target="_blank">MathJax</a>. The code is available at the <a href="https://github.com/Ephraim-Bryski/seeciv" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The programs up currently are just tests to demonstrate everying working. I currently have the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/79673-apps-for-solid-mechanics" target="_blank">programs</a> I would like to incporporate on MathWorks File Exchange and written in MatLab. The material so far is just Solid Mechanics but I have ideas for programs in Fluid Mechanics, Transporation, and more.

    <div class="title">Public Use</div>
    <p>
        The site and its code is open for anyone to use. I welcome people to work with the code however they can think of. The pages itself can be embedded into presentations for demonstrations, and new pages can also be built off of the pre-existing code. If you build off of what I have created, feel free to put it on GitHub.

        If you do use the site or the code, please make sure to include me (Ephraim Bryski) in an acknowledgement.
